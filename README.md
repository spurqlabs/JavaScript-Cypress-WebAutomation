# JavaScript Cypress Web Automation

This repository contains a sample framework for **JavaScript-based UI automation** using **Cypress**, a powerful end-to-end testing framework. It demonstrates best practices for writing maintainable test scripts for modern web applications.

## Overview

This repository is intended for developers and QA engineers looking to automate UI testing for their applications. Cypress is a popular choice for UI automation due to its speed, reliability, and ease of setup. The test scripts and framework in this repository follow modern testing patterns, and the detailed blog post below provides further insight into the implementation.

## Features

- **Cypress Integration**: Set up Cypress for automating web-based user interfaces.
- **Test Organization**: The project uses a well-structured folder hierarchy for test files.
- **Assertions & Hooks**: Includes examples of assertions, `before`, `beforeEach`, and other hooks to streamline testing.
- **Reusable Code**: Promotes the reuse of test scripts and configuration through modular design.
- **Continuous Integration (CI)**: Ready to integrate with CI tools for automated test execution.

- `cypress/fixtures`: Sample data for use in tests.
- `cypress/integration/tests`: The actual test cases.
cypress/plugins: Custom plugins for extending Cypress functionality.
- `cypress/support`: Helper files and custom commands.
- `cypress.config.js`: Cypress configuration settings.
- `package.json`: Project dependencies and scripts.
- `README.md`: This file.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- `Node.js` and `npm` installed on your machine.
- Familiarity with JavaScript and Cypress basics.
- A web application to automate (e.g., a simple web page or a complex web app).

### Installation
1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/spurqlabs/JavaScript-Cypress-WebAutomation.git
2. Navigate into the project directory: `cd JavaScript-Cypress-WebAutomation`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Start Cypress: `npx cypress open`
5. Run tests: `npx cypress run --headed`
6. Explore the Cypress dashboard for detailed test results and analysis.

## Writing and Running Tests

Cypress simplifies the process of writing and executing UI automation scripts. Below is an example of how you can structure test cases in this repository.

```javascript
describe('Test Suite Name', () => {
  beforeEach(() => {
    //Code to execute before every test.....
  });

  it('Test Case Name', () => {
    //Code.....
  });
});
```

### Key Concepts
- `describe()` block: Groups related test cases.
- `it()` block: Defines a single test case.
- `beforeEach()` and `afterEach()` hooks: Execute code before or after each test case
- Cypress commands: `cy.get(), cy.type(), cy.click()`, and more are used to interact with elements.
